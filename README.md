# Block-Associative-Memory
Associative memory using (locality sensitive) hashing to select weight vectors.

This allows large and fast associative memory. The issue is being revisited because there are fast neural networks that you may wish to add an external memory bank to. It would be better if there was not too much of a speed mismatch between the 2 systems.
